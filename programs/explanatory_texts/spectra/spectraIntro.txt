Welcome to the MAPLE Lab Spectra Demonstration! Using the parameters below, you can examine timbre of sounds. Select the fundamental frequency and the intensity of each harmonic. Use the Play/Mute button to start and stop the sound. To explore how power spectra are not representative of real instruments, try playing a dynamic spectra sound.
