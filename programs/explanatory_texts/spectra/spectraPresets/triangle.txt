The triangle wave is composed of an incomplete harmonic series, where only the odd harmonics are played (i.e. 1, 3, etc.). Each odd harmonic's intensity is given by the formula â€œ1/(n^2)" where n is the harmonic number. The phases each successive played harmonic is shifted by pi. For example, if the 1st harmonic has a phase of 0, the 3rd harmonic has a phase of pi, followed by a phase of 0 again for the 5th harmonic. The phase of the 2nd and 4th (or any of the even harmonics) is inconsequential as they are not played in the triangle wave.
