The reverse sawtooth wave is composed of a complete harmonic series. Each odd harmonic's intensity is given by the formula "1/n" where n is the harmonic number. To create a sawtooth wave, the phase of all harmonics played must be 0. Because the reverse sawtooth wave has all the harmonics, it can be compared to brass instruments such as the trumpet.
