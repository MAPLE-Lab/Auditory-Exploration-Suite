# A.E.S. Tasklist
_Updated 2016/01/04_
Class is 3rd week (Jan 17th - 10:30am; Thursday Jan 19th - 9:30-11:20) - TSH 120
So need to know by the 16th to play around
If earlier 

Get Audacity
Normalize volumes?

* * *
##**Splashscreen**

_TO-DOs_

* Technical details button on all apps with details


_COMPLETED_

* Update splash with Dr. Schutz's image email
* Rename the Go Back to Home
* Version tags (0.1.#)

* * *

##**Tuning Demonstration**

_TO-DOs_

* Dropdown menu for Focus tone (third/fourth/fifth/etc.)
* Number of harmonics active -> control the loops of harmonics
* Add an IF statement so that the harmonic desired to manipulate cannot be manipulated/added by the LOOP
* Variable: fade in rate
* Make freq spectra log and set linlin->linexp

</p>

* 2D slider for rate and delay (window of tolerance? thresholds?)
* Tone that moves come through a different - for science

</p>

* Array? Dropdown - set the values of the 0,0,0,1,0,0,0,0etc.
* And the second the
* MasterVolume? arg toggle
* Be careful with 
* Toggle helps so later in the program 
* Screen might need to be bigger
* Extend the Freq range of the spectra


_COMPLETED_

* splashscreen
* tonic frequency
* Move Slides OUT of Dropbox once all received
* Rename as "Overtone "popout""
* Add "Reset" button to put it back to correct tuning
* Overall volume slider
* Spectra - can the frequency axis be on the vertical axis (option to go back and forth)? = possibility using Pen, but requires different data collection: http://sccode.org/1-1HR
* Add axis if not possible


* * *

##**Spectra Demonstration**

_TO-DOs_

* Make the sound buttons be 2 switch
* At the end of the sound the button springs back up
* Amadeus slow-mo the .WAV to get better sample rate and check refresh rate
* Move it over to the left side where it applies, and rename becasue the Power Spectra won't use it
* Play button / Silence sounds button
* Auto-off setting
* Amadeus/Audacity can cut the .aiff
* Remove the Hold to Play thing from the InsRec to prove a point of the artificiality
* Rename to Fixed Spectra and Dynamic Spectra and Audio Recording
* Add Square and Triangle waves and check that the Saw isn't just a Triangle and find the truth of the Sawtooth --> can check the lab wiki for information on the mathematics - /-Classifying+Sounds
* Set Buttons as Global variables - funprogramming.org/134-etc....

</p>

* .plot the data of the harmonic spectra, and plots just the spectra - fake it beause of the time axis - more pedagogically valuable 
* Import and analyze sound? See how that spectrogram did it...
* Dr. Ballora recommends PVOC (may need extension/quark)
* Still need a way to analyze the harmonics for their time-varying values
* Add OSC Delay for x.free for preset activations = if necessary?
* For GraphClick, set 0db = 100u, -96=0u --> 0-100 on y, exported, points at top of bars - can there be more frames?
* Add ticks at the bottom / overtone lines that work with the tonic frequency =
* See Amadeus (in the lab licenses)
* See DropBox files with videos - use GraphClick to take from those
* Tuning fork, Trumpet, Flute, Horn
* Why doesn't Spectra when Win.closed not shut down the server
* Open for keyboard usage for picking fundamental (this should be possible) - needs discussion (see MAX/MSP tone generator online at www.maplelab.net/software)
* Shade/colour keys on piano in proportion to amount of freq in there (intensity?)



_COMPLETED_

* Under harmonics, give frequencies of each harmonic underneath the intensity value box
* Go up to harmonic 16
* Fix memory spectra allocation
* From error messages it is clear it is a Node tree allocation problem - just later add proper allocations at the start of the program//Remove artifact --> have it free at end..doneAction? or cheap box // BOXED TRIM
* But still issue present in Oscilloscope - so needs a true solution (because additively negative) = COMPLETE, the audio must go to 0 at end or else artifact
* Add oscilloscope button

* * *

##**Class Wiki**

_TO-DOs_

* The video can introduce the app during lecture

_COMPLETED_

* Add friendly image
* Add details on opening "SuperCollider.app" because that's still confusing
* And how to work with the new RelativePath version


* * *

##**Critical Bands**

* Lin vs Log freqs
* Critical bands highlights
* The 3D vid and audios side-by-side
