# MAES Tasklist (WIP)
_Date_

Splashscreen
//Update splash with Dr. Schutz's image email = COMPLETE

// "2MC3 Tuning Demonstration"
//splashscreen = COMPLETED
//tonic frequency = COMPLETED

//Spectra - can the frequency axis be on the vertical axis (option to go back and forth)? = possibility using Pen, but requires different data collection: http://sccode.org/1-1HR
//Add axis if not possible
//Dropdown menu for Focus tone (third/fourth/fifth/etc.)
///Number of harmonics active -> control the loops of harmonics
//Add an IF statement so that the harmonic desired to manipulate cannot be manipulated/added by the LOOP
//Variable: fade in rate

///2D slider for rate and delay (window of tolerance? thresholds?)
///Tone that moves come through a different - for science
///Move Slides OUT of Dropbox once all received = COMPLETE



// "2MC3 Spectra Demonstration"

//Under harmonics, give frequencies of each harmonic underneath the intensity value box = COMPLETE
//Go up to harmonic 16 = COMPLETE
//Import and analyze sound? See how that spectrogram did it...
///Dr. Ballora recommends PVOC (may need extension/quark)
//Still need a way to analyze the harmonics for their time-varying values
//Fix memory spectra allocation = COMPLETE(?)
////From error messages it is clear it is a Node tree allocation problem - just later add proper allocations at the start of the program
//Remove artifact --> have it free at end.. doneAction? or cheap box // BOXED TRIM = COMPLETE
////But still issue present in Oscilloscope - so needs a true solution (because additively negative) = COMPLETE, the audio must go to 0 at end or else artifact
//Add OSC Delay for x.free for preset activations = if necessary?
//Add oscilloscope button = COMPLETE

//For GraphClick, set 0db = 100u, -96=0u
//Add ticks at the bottom / overtone lines that work with the tonic frequency =
///See Amadeus (in the lab licenses)
///See DropBox files with videos - use GraphClick to take from those
//Tuning fork, Trumpet, Flute, Horn
